# Password-Generator

A password generator that asks the user if they want to choose the amount of a certain character they want in their 
password. If not then they will only choose how many characters will be in the password. Then the program will 
randomly shuffle the characters to generate a random password each time it is ran. I implemented the program in two
languages to see how one would translate the code in another language.
